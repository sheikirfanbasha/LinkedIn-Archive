# Deployment

## GitHub Pages (recommended default)

1. **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions.**
2. Push to `main`, or run **Actions → Deploy site → Run workflow**.
3. `deploy.yml` installs dependencies with `uv`, runs `linkedin-archive validate`, then `linkedin-archive build`, uploads `dist/` as a Pages artifact, and deploys it. `dist/` is never committed to the repository — it's rebuilt fresh on every deploy (see `docs/architecture.md` for why).
4. Your site is live at `https://<you>.github.io/<repo>/` (or `https://<you>.github.io/` for a repo named `<you>.github.io`).

Set `site.url` in `config.yaml` to match this URL (or your custom domain, below) — it's used for canonical links, the sitemap, and the RSS feed.

### If your repo is a fork: `push` won't auto-deploy

GitHub does not create workflow runs for `push` (or `pull_request`, or `schedule`) events on a
repository that's a fork, even once you've enabled Actions for it and even if the repo, its
branches, and its workflows all otherwise look fully enabled via the API (`state: active`,
`actions/permissions` → `enabled: true`). `workflow_dispatch` — a manually-requested run — is the
one trigger type that's exempt, and it works normally. This was confirmed directly against this
repo: two plain `git push`es to `main` (content-only changes, matching `deploy.yml`'s path filter)
produced zero workflow runs, while `gh workflow run deploy.yml` succeeded every time and the
identical workflow file fires correctly on `push` in the non-fork upstream this repo was forked
from.

Until the fork is detached from its upstream (only possible by asking GitHub Support to detach
it — there's no self-service button or API for this), publish after every merge to `main` with:

```bash
gh workflow run deploy.yml --repo <you>/<repo>
```

## Custom domain

1. Buy/own a domain (any registrar).
2. Add DNS records at your registrar or DNS provider:
   - **Apex domain** (`example.com`): four `A` records pointing at GitHub Pages' IPs (`185.199.108.153`, `185.199.109.153`, `185.199.110.153`, `185.199.111.153`), plus `AAAA` records if you want IPv6 (`2606:50c0:8000::153`, `2606:50c0:8001::153`, `2606:50c0:8002::153`, `2606:50c0:8003::153`).
   - **Subdomain** (`archive.example.com`): a `CNAME` record pointing at `<you>.github.io`.
3. In the repo, **Settings → Pages → Custom domain**, enter your domain, save. This is a repository setting, not something derived from the build output, so it isn't affected by `dist/` being rebuilt from scratch on every deploy — it applies to every future deploy automatically. (You do *not* need a `CNAME` file anywhere in the repo: this project's `deploy.yml` publishes through `actions/deploy-pages`, which — unlike the older "deploy from a branch" source — ignores any `CNAME` file in the build output entirely and reads the domain purely from this Pages setting. A `static/CNAME` file would in any case land at `dist/static/CNAME`, not `dist/CNAME`, since `static/` is copied wholesale into `dist/static/`.)
4. Check **Enforce HTTPS** once GitHub finishes issuing a certificate (can take a few minutes to a few hours after DNS propagates).
5. Update `site.url` in `config.yaml` to `https://your-domain`.

## Self-hosting elsewhere

`dist/` is a plain static site — no server-side code, no environment-specific paths beyond what's baked in at build time. Deploy it to Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, S3 + CloudFront, or any static file host:

```bash
uv run linkedin-archive build
# upload the contents of dist/ to your host of choice
```

Set `site.url` in `config.yaml` to that host's URL before building, since it's baked into canonical links, the sitemap, and RSS at build time.

## Verifying a deployment

```bash
uv run linkedin-archive validate   # content/config sanity
uv run linkedin-archive build      # regenerate dist/
uv run linkedin-archive serve      # preview locally before pushing
```

Check: home page loads, a post page opens directly, `/search/` returns results, `/feed.xml` and `/sitemap.xml` are well-formed, dark/light mode toggles, and the layout is usable on a narrow viewport.
